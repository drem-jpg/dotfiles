As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":394,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1622132705","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.jpg?modified=1622132705","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":377,"caption":"Manager - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200987.png?modified=1622132709","width":970,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200987.jpg?modified=1622132709","thumbnailWidth":449,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Editor - showing RegExp tester and colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200985.png?modified=1622132711","width":538,"height":610,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200985.jpg?modified=1622132711","thumbnailWidth":353,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200988.png?modified=1622132713","width":576,"height":727,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200988.jpg?modified=1622132713","thumbnailWidth":317,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - finding styles"}],"homepageURL":"https://add0n.com/stylus.html","supportURL":"https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6541,"reviewCount":348,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":2176,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4451438/styl_us-2.3.14.xpi","updateDate":1742562897000},{"id":"CanvasBlocker@kkapsner.de","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/534/534930-32.png?modified=1581849561","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/534/534930-64.png?modified=1581849561","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/534/534930-128.png?modified=1581849561"},"type":"extension","name":"CanvasBlocker","version":"1.11","creator":{"name":"kkapsner","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11033762/"},"developers":[],"description":"Alters some JS APIs to prevent fingerprinting.","fullDescription":"This add-on allows users to prevent websites from using some Javascript APIs to fingerprint them.

Long-click the new tab button to open a new Container tab.\n\nFor more information on how to use Multi-Account Containers, visit our help articles:\n\n\nAll about Multi Account Containers\nMulti Container user - how to use Mozilla VPN\nVPN subscriber - how to use Multi Account Containers","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266157.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266157.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266158.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266158.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266160.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266160.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266159.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266159.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers/#readme","supportURL":"https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers/issues","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6032,"reviewCount":3436,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":9152,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4355970/multi_account_containers-8.2.0.xpi","updateDate":1727193014000},{"id":"keepassxc-browser@keepassxc.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/917/917354-32.png?modified=1723572339","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/917/917354-64.png?modified=1723572339","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/917/917354-128.png?modified=1723572339"},"type":"extension","name":"KeePassXC-Browser","version":"1.9.7","creator":{"name":"KeePassXC Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13036987/"},"developers":[],"description":"Official browser plugin for the KeePassXC password manager (https://keepassxc.org).","fullDescription":"Official browser plugin for the KeePassXC password manager (https://keepassxc.org).\n\nThe thing computers can do best is storing information.\nYou shouldn't waste your time trying to remember and type your passwords.\nKeePassXC can store your passwords safely and auto-type them into your everyday websites and applications.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/197/197999.png?modified=1622132902","width":700,"height":198,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/197/197999.jpg?modified=1622132902","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":151,"caption":"KeePassXC"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/234/234592.png?modified=1622132905","width":1513,"height":1047,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/234/234592.jpg?modified=1622132905","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":369,"caption":"Settings page"}],"homepageURL":"https://keepassxc.org/","supportURL":"https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc-browser","contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/varjolintu?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.257,"reviewCount":271,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":3888,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4441759/keepassxc_browser-1.9.7.xpi","updateDate":1741092869000},{"id":"{d7742d87-e61d-4b78-b8a1-b469842139fa}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/808/808538-32.png?modified=683f1684","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/808/808538-64.png?modified=683f1684","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/808/808538-128.png?modified=683f1684"},"type":"extension","name":"Vimium","version":"2.1.2","creator":{"name":"Phil Crosby","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/14971172/"},"developers":[{"name":"Stephen Blott","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12979436/"}],"description":"The Hacker's Browser.

The goal of DeArrow is to make titles accurate and reduce sensationalism.\n\nDeArrow is a paid (if you want) browser extension. You can purchase an unlimited-use license key for 1$. However, if you cannot, or do not want to pay, you can use the extension by clicking the \"I can't/don't want to pay\" button.\n\nTitles can be any arbitrary text. Thumbnails are screenshots from specific timestamps in the video. These are user submitted and voted on.\n\nBy default, if there are no submissions, it will format the original title to the user-specified format, and set a screenshot from a random timestamp as the thumbnail. This can be configured in the options to disable formatting, or show the original thumbnail by default.\n\nIf the original thumbnail is actually good, you can still vote for it in the submission menu, and then it will act like a submission.\n\nNo more dealing with clickbait, arrows, or annoying faces.\n\nUsers can submit better titles and thumbnails for each video and vote on them.\n\nHow does DeArrow differ from Clickbait Remover for YouTube?\n- Unlike Clickbait Remover, DeArrow's main purpose is for crowdsourcing better titles and thumbnails\n\n- When a crowdsourced title is not available, DeArrow will auto-format it according to your setting, but does it in a more sophisticated way than Clickbait Remover. Instead of only setting all words to lower case, or capitalizing every word, DeArrow supports casing systems such as \"Title Case\" and \"Sentence case\". These will still allow acronyms and proper names to remain capitalized.\n\n- When a crowdsourced thumbnail is not available, DeArrow by default shows a screenshot at a random timestamp in the video. Clickbait Remover's thumbnails use YouTube auto-generated thumbnails, and while they are seemingly random, they are chosen by a machine learning algorithm to favor faces with expressions, and other overstimulating features. DeArrow uses truly random timestamps generated by its own server. DeArrow will also check the SponsorBlock database to ensure the randomized thumbnail is not inside of a sponsor segment.\n\n---\n\nSource code: https://github.com/ajayyy/DeArrow\n\nPermissions:\n\nAccess your data for youtube.com, www.youtube-nocookie.com:\n- Used to modify the YouTube webpage\n\nThis add-on may also **ask*\" to access data for any website:\n- You can add your own instances of 3rd party YouTube front-ends, and it will ask for permission to modify each site you add\n- It will never ask for permission for all sites, only the sites you request\n- Invidious support is not finished at the moment","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/296/296628.png?modified=1710183327","width":1234,"height":1037,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/296/296628.jpg?modified=1710183327","thumbnailWidth":476,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Before and after of four different channels"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/283/283558.png?modified=1710183327","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/283/283558.jpg?modified=1710183327","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Submitting a new title and thumbnail"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/296/296629.png?modified=1710183333","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/296/296629.jpg?modified=1710183333","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Tom Scott's YouTube channel with thumbnails and titles replaced by DeArrow"}],"homepageURL":"https://dearrow.ajay.app","supportURL":"https://ajay.app","contributionURL":"https://github.com/sponsors/ajayyy-org?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.0369,"reviewCount":157,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dearrow/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":693,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dearrow/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4451121/dearrow-2.0.5.xpi","updateDate":1741618434000},{"id":"{2662ff67-b302-4363-95f3-b050218bd72c}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2817/2817302-32.png?modified=b965e92b","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2817/2817302-64.png?modified=b965e92b","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2817/2817302-128.png?modified=b965e92b"},"type":"extension","name":"UnTrap for YouTube","version":"8.3.1","creator":{"name":"Yevhen Tretiakov","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17777732/"},"developers":[],"description":"Hide YouTube recommendations, shorts, comments, suggestions, related videos, trending and other distractions.","fullDescription":"UnTrap is a browser extension who seek a focused and distraction-free YouTube browsing experience.\n\nSay goodbye to YouTube related videos, shorts, comments, homepage recommendations, and the incessant barrage of distractions.\n\nWith over 200+ customization options, UnTrap empowers you to take control of your YouTube journey.
